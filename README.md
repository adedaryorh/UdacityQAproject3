Dependencies

- This project uses Azure DevOps to build a CI/CD pipeline that creates disposable test environments and runs a variety of automated tests to ensure quality releases. It uses Terraform to deploy the infrastructure, Azure App Services to host the web application and Azure Pipelines to provision, build, deploy and test the project. The automated tests run on a self-hosted virtual machine (Linux) and consist of: UI Tests with selenium, Integration Tests with postman, Stress Test and Endurance Test with jmeter. Additionally, it uses an Azure Log Analytics workspace to monitor and provide insight into the application's behavior.
